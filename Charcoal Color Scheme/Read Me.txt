Charcoal Color Scheme 
     for mikroC Pro
---------------------------

Version 1.0 - Sept 26, 2012

The Charcoal color scheme is used to customize the syntax highlighting in mikroC Pro. The scheme is designed to work with all of the MikroElektronika mikroC Pro compilers. The Charcoal color scheme has been tested with the mikroC Pro for PIC, mikroC Pro for dsPIC, and mikroC Pro for PIC32 compilers.

I created this color scheme to make the programming experience more enjoyable. The color palette for Charcoal was inspired from my previous "Midnight Blue" theme. My goal was to create a theme that was easier on the eyes with a darker and less saturated background than Midnight Blue.

Charcoal was created by Andrew Hazelden.

Installation:

1. Install the Color Scheme

Install the Charcoal Color Scheme by copying the file "Charcoal.col" from the "Install" folder into the mikroC Pro program directory.

For example, on Windows 7, the mikroC Pro for PIC32 program directory is located at:
C:\Users\Public\Documents\Mikroelektronika\mikroC PRO for PIC32

For example, on Windows XP, the mikroC Pro for PIC32 program directory is located at:
C:\Program Files\Mikroelektronika\mikroC Pro for PIC32

2. Activate the Color Scheme in mikroC

Start by launching mikroC Pro. Go to the Tools menu and select the "Options" menu item. 

In the Options window, click on the Editor tab and select the "Style" icon. In the IDE Style section set the IDE Style to "Office XP".

Next, click on the Editor Colors tab. Set the Current Scheme to "Charcoal".

Click Okay.

3. You are now ready to enjoy the Charcoal theme.
